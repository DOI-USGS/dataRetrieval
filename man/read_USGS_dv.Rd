\arguments{
\item{monitoring_location_id}{A unique identifier representing a single monitoring
location. This corresponds to the id field in the sites endpoint. Monitoring
location IDs are created by combining the agency code of the agency responsible
for the monitoring location (e.g. USGS) with the ID number of the monitoring
location (e.g. 02238500), separated by a hyphen (e.g. USGS-02238500).}

\item{parameter_code}{Parameter codes are 5-digit codes used to identify the
constituent measured and the units of measure.}

\item{statistic_id}{A code corresponding to the statistic an observation represents.
Example codes include 00001 (max), 00002 (min), and 00003 (mean).}

\item{properties}{The properties that should be included for each feature. The
parameter value is a comma-separated list of property names. Available values:
id, timeseries_id, monitoring_location_id, parameter_code, statistic_id, time,
value, unit_of_measure, approval_status, qualifier, last_modified.}

\item{bbox}{Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding
box are selected.The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending
on whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or
depth).}

\item{timeseries_id}{A unique identifier representing a single timeseries.
This corresponds to the id field in the timeseries-metadata endpoint.}

\item{id}{A universally unique identifier (UUID) representing a single version
of a record. It is not stable over time. Every time the record is refreshed in
our database (which may happen as part of normal operations and does not imply
any change to the data itself) a new ID will be generated. To uniquely identify
a single observation over time, compare the time and timeseries_id fields; each
timeseries will only have a single observation at a given time.}

\item{approval_status}{Some of the data that you have obtained from this U.S.
Geological Survey database may not have received Director's approval. Any such
data values are qualified as provisional and are subject to revision. Provisional
data are released on the condition that neither the USGS nor the United States
Government may be held liable for any damages resulting from its use. This field
reflects the approval status of each record, and is either "Approved", meaning
processing review has been completed and the data is approved for publication,
or "Provisional" and subject to revision.}

\item{unit_of_measure}{A human-readable description of the units of measurement
associated with an observation.}

\item{qualifier}{This field indicates any qualifiers associated with an observation,
for instance if a sensor may have been impacted by ice or if values were estimated.}

\item{value}{The value of the observation. Values are transmitted as strings
in the JSON response format in order to preserve precision.}

\item{last_modified}{The last time a record was refreshed in our database. This
may happen due to regular operational processes and does not necessarily indicate
anything about the measurement has changed. You can query this field using
date-times or intervals.}

\item{limit}{The optional limit parameter limits the number of items that are
presented in the response document. Only items are counted that are on the
first level of the collection in the response document. Nested objects
contained within the explicitly requested items shall not be counted.}

\item{crs}{Indicates the coordinate reference system for the results.}

\item{bbox_crs}{Indicates the coordinate reference system for the given bbox
coordinates.}

\item{skipGeometry}{This option can be used to skip response geometries for
each feature.}

\item{datetime}{Either a date-time or an interval. Only features that have a
temporal property that intersects the value of datetime are selected. If a 
feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the server
whether only a single temporal property is used to determine the extent or
all relevant temporal properties.}

\item{no_sf}{Boolean, whether or not to return an "sf" object. TRUE returns
a basic data frame, FALSE returns a "sf" object.}

\item{convertType}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function
will convert the data to dates and qualifier to string vector.}

\item{offset}{The optional offset parameter indicates the index within the
result set from which the server shall begin presenting results in the response
document. The first element has an index of 0 (default).}

\item{time}{The date an observation represents.}

\description{
Daily data provide one data value to represent water conditions for the day.
Throughout much of the history of the USGS, the primary water data available
was daily data collected manually at the monitoring location once each day.
With improved availability of computer storage and automated transmission of
data, the daily data published today are generally a statistical summary or
metric of the continuous data collected each day, such as the daily mean,
minimum, or maximum value. Daily data are automatically calculated from the
continuous data of the same parameter code and are described by parameter code
and a statistic code. These data have also been referred to as "daily values"
or "DV".
