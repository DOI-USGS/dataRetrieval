\description{
Daily data provide one data value to represent water conditions for the day.
Throughout much of the history of the USGS, the primary water data available
was daily data collected manually at the monitoring location once each day.
With improved availability of computer storage and automated transmission of
data, the daily data published today are generally a statistical summary or
metric of the continuous data collected each day, such as the daily mean,
minimum, or maximum value. Daily data are automatically calculated from the
continuous data of the same parameter code and are described by parameter code
and a statistic code. These data have also been referred to as "daily values"
or "DV".
