\arguments{
\item{monitoring_location_id}{A unique identifier representing a single monitoring
location. This corresponds to the id field in the sites endpoint. Monitoring
location IDs are created by combining the agency code of the agency responsible
for the monitoring location (e.g. USGS) with the ID number of the monitoring
location (e.g. 02238500), separated by a hyphen (e.g. USGS-02238500).}

\item{parameter_code}{Parameter codes are 5-digit codes used to identify the
constituent measured and the units of measure.}

\item{parameter_name}{A human-understandable name corresponding to parameter_code.}

\item{properties}{The properties that should be included for each feature. The
parameter value is a comma-separated list of property names. Available values:
geometry, id, unit_of_measure, parameter_name, parameter_code, statistic_id,
last_modified, begin, end, computation_period_identifier, computation_identifier,
thresholds, sublocation_identifier, primary, monitoring_location_id, web_description.}

\item{limit}{The optional limit parameter limits the number of items that are
presented in the response document. Only items are counted that are on the
first level of the collection in the response document. Nested objects
contained within the explicitly requested items shall not be counted.}

\item{statistic_id}{A code corresponding to the statistic an observation represents.
Example codes include 00001 (max), 00002 (min), and 00003 (mean).}

\item{last_modified}{The last time a record was refreshed in our database. This
may happen due to regular operational processes and does not necessarily indicate
anything about the measurement has changed. You can query this field using
date-times or intervals.}

\item{begin}{The datetime of the earliest observation in the timeseries.
Together with end, this field represents the period of record of a timeseries.
Note that some timeseries may have large gaps in their collection record.}

\item{end}{The datetime of the most recent observation in the timeseries.
Data returned by this endpoint updates at most once per day, and potentially
less frequently than that, and as such there may be more recent observations
within a timeseries than the timeseries end value reflects. Together with begin,
this field represents the period of record of a timeseries. It is additionally
used to determine whether a timeseries is "active".}

\item{unit_of_measure}{A human-readable description of the units of measurement
associated with an observation.}

\item{computation_period_identifier}{Indicates the period of data used for
any statistical computations.}

\item{computation_identifier}{Indicates whether the data from this timeseries
represent a specific statistical computation.}

\item{thresholds}{Thresholds represent known numeric limits for a timeseries,
for example the historic maximum value for a parameter or a level below which
a sensor is non-operative. These thresholds are sometimes used to automatically
determine if an observation is erroneous due to sensor error, and therefore
shouldn't be included in the timeseries.}

\item{sublocation_identifier}{An optional human-readable identifier used to
specify where measurements are recorded at a monitoring location.}

\item{primary}{A flag identifying if the timeseries is a "primary" timeseries.
"Primary" timeseries (which have this flag) are standard observations which
undergo Bureau review and approval processes. Non-primary timeseries, which
will have missing values for "primary", are provisional datasets made available
to meet the need for timely best science and to assist with daily operations
which need real-time information. Non-primary timeseries data are only retained
by this system for 120 days. See the USGS Provisional Data Statement for more information.}

\item{web_description}{A description of what this timeseries represents, as
used by WDFN and other USGS data dissemination products.}

\item{skipGeometry}{This option can be used to skip response geometries for
each feature.}

\item{convertType}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function
will convert the data to dates and qualifier to string vector.}

\item{crs}{Indicates the coordinate reference system for the results.}
}
\description{
Daily data and continuous measurements are grouped into timeseries, which
represent a collection of observations of a single parameter, potentially
aggregated using a standard statistic, at a single site. This endpoint provides
metadata about those timeseries, including their operational thresholds, units
of measurement, and when the earliest and most recent observations in a timeseries
occurred.
