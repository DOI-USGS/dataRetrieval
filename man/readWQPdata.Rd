\usage{
readWQPdata(
  ...,
  querySummary = FALSE,
  tz = "UTC",
  ignore_attributes = FALSE,
  convertType = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{see \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation} for a complete list of options. A list of arguments can also be supplied.}

\item{querySummary}{logical to ONLY return the number of records and unique sites that will be returned from this query. This argument is not supported via the combined list from the \dots argument}

\item{tz}{character to set timezone attribute of dateTime. Default is "UTC", and converts the 
date times to UTC, properly accounting for daylight savings times based on the data's provided tz_cd column.
Possible values to provide are "America/New_York","America/Chicago", "America/Denver","America/Los_Angeles",
"America/Anchorage", as well as the following which do not use daylight savings time: "America/Honolulu",
"America/Jamaica","America/Managua","America/Phoenix", and "America/Metlakatla". See also  \code{OlsonNames()} 
for more information on time zones.}

\item{ignore_attributes}{logical to choose to ignore fetching site and parameter attributes. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{convertType}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function will convert the data to dates, datetimes,
numerics based on a standard algorithm. If false, everything is returned as a character.}
