\title{Reads groundwater level measurements from NWISweb.}
\usage{
readNWISgwl(siteNumbers, startDate = "", endDate = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{siteNumbers}{string USGS site number (or multiple sites).  This is usually an 8 digit number}

\item{startDate}{string starting date for data retrieval in the form YYYY-MM-DD.}

\item{endDate}{string ending date for data retrieval in the form YYYY-MM-DD.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\tabular{lll}{
Name \tab Type \tab Description \cr
agency \tab character \tab The NWIS code for the agency reporting the data\cr
site \tab character \tab The USGS site number \cr
datetime \tab character \tab The date and time of the value as a character \cr
tz_cd \tab character \tab The time zone code for datetime \cr
code \tab character \tab Any codes that qualify the corresponding value\cr
value \tab numeric \tab The numeric value for the parameter \cr
}
Note that code and value are repeated for the parameters requested. The names are of the form
X_D_P_S, where X is literal,
D is an option description of the parameter,
P is the parameter code,
and S is the statistic code (if applicable).

There are also several useful attributes attached to the data frame:
\tabular{lll}{
Name \tab Type \tab Description \cr
url \tab character \tab The url used to generate the data \cr
siteInfo \tab data.frame \tab A data frame containing information on the requested sites \cr
variableInfo \tab data.frame \tab A data frame containing information on the requested parameters \cr
statisticInfo \tab data.frame \tab A data frame containing information on the requested statistics on the data \cr
queryTime \tab POSIXct \tab The time the data was returned \cr
}
}
