\title{Reads groundwater level measurements from NWISweb.}
\usage{
readNWISgwl(siteNumbers, startDate = "", endDate = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{siteNumbers}{character USGS site number (or multiple sites).  This is usually an 8 digit number}

\item{startDate}{character starting date for data retrieval in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Default is "" which indicates
retrieval for the earliest possible record.}

\item{endDate}{character ending date for data retrieval in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Default is "" which indicates
retrieval for the latest possible record.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the following columns:
\tabular{lll}{
Name \tab Type \tab Description \cr
agency_cd \tab character \tab The NWIS code for the agency reporting the data\cr
site_no \tab character \tab The USGS site number \cr
site_tp_cd \tab character \tab Site type code \cr
lev_dt \tab Date \tab Date level measured\cr
lev_tm \tab character \tab Time level measured \cr
lev_tz_cd \tab character \tab Time datum \cr
lev_va \tab numeric \tab Water level value in feet below land surface\cr
sl_lev_va \tab numeric \tab Water level value in feet above specific vertical datum \cr
lev_status_cd \tab character \tab The status of the site at the time the water level was measured \cr
lev_agency_cd \tab character \tab The agency code of the person measuring the water level \cr
}

There are also several useful attributes attached to the data frame:
\tabular{lll}{
Name \tab Type \tab Description \cr
url \tab character \tab The url used to generate the data \cr
queryTime \tab POSIXct \tab The time the data was returned \cr

\description{
Reads groundwater level measurements from NWISweb. Mixed date/times come back from the service
depending on the year that the data was collected. See \url{http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/gw}
for details about groundwater. Groundwater dates and times are returned in many different formats, therefore the
date/time information is returned as a character string. Users will need to convert to a date object.
See \url{http://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/GW-Levels-Service.html} for more information.
