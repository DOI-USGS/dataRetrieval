\usage{
readWQPsummary(..., checkHeader = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{see \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation}
 for a complete list of options. A list of arguments can also be supplied.
One way to figure out how to construct a WQP query is to go to the "Advanced" 
form in the Water Quality Portal:
\url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#mimeType=csv&providers=NWIS&providers=STORET}
Use the form to discover what parameters are available. Once the query is 
set in the form, scroll down to the "Query URL". You will see the parameters
after "https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#". For example, if you chose "Nutrient"
in the Characteristic Group dropdown, you will see characteristicType=Nutrient
in the Query URL. The corresponding argument for dataRetrieval is
characteristicType = "Nutrient". dataRetrieval users do not need to include
mimeType, zip, and providers is optional (these arguments are picked automatically).}

\item{checkHeader}{logical, defaults to \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the code
will check that the curl header response for number of rows matches the actual
number of rows. During transition to WQX 3.0 profiles, it's unclear if
the counts will be correct.}

\value{
A data frame from the data returned from the Water Quality Portal
}
\description{
Returns a list of sites with year-by-year information on what data is available.
The function gets the data from: \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us}.
Arguments to the function should be based on
\url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation}.
The information returned from this function describes the
available data at the WQP sites, and some metadata on the sites themselves.
