\usage{
readWQPsummary(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{\dots}{see \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation}
 for a complete list of options. A list of arguments can also be supplied.
One way to figure out how to construct a WQP query is to go to the "Advanced" 
form in the Water Quality Portal:
\url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#mimeType=csv&providers=NWIS&providers=STORET}
Use the form to discover what parameters are available. Once the query is 
set in the form, scroll down to the "Query URL". You will see the parameters
after "https://www.waterqualitydata.us/#". For example, if you chose "Nutrient"
in the Characteristic Group dropdown, you will see characteristicType=Nutrient
in the Query URL. The corresponding argument for dataRetrieval is
characteristicType = "Nutrient". dataRetrieval users do not need to include
mimeType, and providers is optional (these arguments are picked automatically).}
}
\value{
A data frame from the data returned from the Water Quality Portal
}
\description{
Returns a list of sites with year-by-year information on what data is available.
The function gets the data from: \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us}.
Arguments to the function should be based on
\url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation}.
The information returned from this function describes the
available data at the WQP sites, and some metadata on the sites themselves.
