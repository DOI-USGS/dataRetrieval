\arguments{
\item{monitoring_location_id}{A unique identifier representing a single monitoring location. This corresponds to the \code{id} field in the \code{monitoring-locations} endpoint. Monitoring location IDs are created by combining the agency code of the agency responsible for the monitoring location (e.g. USGS) with the ID number of the monitoring location (e.g. 02238500), separated by a hyphen (e.g. USGS-02238500).}

\item{parameter_code}{Parameter codes are 5-digit codes used to identify the constituent measured and the units of measure. A complete list of parameter codes and associated groupings can be found at \url{https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/codes-and-parameters/parameters}.}

\item{parameter_name}{A human-understandable name corresponding to \code{parameter_code}.}

\item{properties}{The properties that should be included for each feature.
The parameter value is a comma-separated list of property names. Available options are
geometry, id, unit_of_measure, parameter_name, parameter_code, statistic_id, last_modified, begin, end, computation_period_identifier, computation_identifier, thresholds, sublocation_identifier, primary, monitoring_location_id, web_description}

\item{limit}{The optional limit parameter limits the number of items that are
presented in the response document. Only items are counted that are on the
first level of the collection in the response document. Nested objects
contained within the explicitly requested items shall not be counted.}

\item{bbox}{Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding
box are selected.The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending
on whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or
depth). Coordinates are assumed to be in crs 4326.}

\item{statistic_id}{A code corresponding to the statistic an observation represents. Example codes include 00001 (max), 00002 (min), and 00003 (mean). A complete list of codes and their descriptions can be found at \url{https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/code/stat_cd_nm_query?stat_nm_cd=\%25&fmt=html}.}

\item{last_modified}{The last time a record was refreshed in our database. This may happen due to regular operational processes and does not necessarily indicate anything about the measurement has changed.
You can query this field using date-times or intervals, adhering to RFC 3339, or using ISO 8601 duration objects. Intervals may be bounded or half-bounded (double-dots at start or end).
Examples:
\itemize{
\item A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
\item A bounded interval: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
\item Half-bounded intervals: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/.." or "../2018-03-18T12:31:12Z"
\item Duration objects: "P1M" for data from the past month or "PT36H" for the last 36 hours
}

Only features that have a \code{last_modified} that intersects the value of datetime are selected. If a feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single temporal property is used to determine the extent or all relevant temporal properties.}

\item{begin}{The datetime of the earliest observation in the time series. Together with \code{end}, this field represents the period of record of a time series. Note that some time series may have large gaps in their collection record. This field is currently in the local time of the monitoring location. We intend to update this \strong{in version v0} to use UTC with a time zone.}

\item{end}{The datetime of the most recent observation in the time series. Data returned by this endpoint updates at most once per day, and potentially less frequently than that, and as such there may be more recent observations within a time series than the time series \code{end} value reflects. Together with \code{begin}, this field represents the period of record of a time series. It is additionally used to determine whether a time series is "active". We intend to update this \strong{in version v0} to use UTC with a time zone.}

\item{unit_of_measure}{A human-readable description of the units of measurement associated with an observation.}

\item{computation_period_identifier}{Indicates the period of data used for any statistical computations.}

\item{computation_identifier}{Indicates whether the data from this time series represent a specific statistical computation.}

\item{thresholds}{Thresholds represent known numeric limits for a time series, for example the historic maximum value for a parameter or a level below which a sensor is non-operative. These thresholds are sometimes used to automatically determine if an observation is erroneous due to sensor error, and therefore shouldn't be included in the time series.}

\item{sublocation_identifier}{An optional human-readable identifier used to specify where measurements are recorded at a monitoring location.}

\item{primary}{A flag identifying if the time series is a "primary" time series. "Primary" time series (which have this flag) are standard observations which undergo \href{https://www.usgs.gov/survey-manual/5028-fundamental-science-practices-review-and-approval-scientific-data-release}{Bureau review and approval processes}. Non-primary time series, which will have missing values for "primary", are provisional datasets made available to meet the need for timely best science and to assist with daily operations which need real-time information. Non-primary time series data are only retained by this system for 120 days. See the \href{https://waterdata.usgs.gov/provisional-data-statement/}{USGS Provisional Data Statement} for more information.}

\item{time_series_id}{A unique identifier representing a single time series. This corresponds to the \code{id} field in the \code{time-series-metadata} endpoint.}

\item{web_description}{A description of what this time series represents, as used by WDFN and other USGS data dissemination products.}

\item{crs}{Indicates the coordinate reference system for the results.}

\item{skipGeometry}{This option can be used to skip response geometries for
each feature. The returning object will be a data frame with no spatial
information.}

\item{convertType}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function
will convert the data to dates and qualifier to string vector.}

\description{
Description Daily data and continuous measurements are grouped into time series, which represent a collection of observations of a single parameter, potentially aggregated using a standard statistic, at a single monitoring location. This endpoint provides metadata about those time series, including their operational thresholds, units of measurement, and when the earliest and most recent observations in a time series occurred.
