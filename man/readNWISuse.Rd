\title{Water use data retrieval from USGS (NWIS)}
\usage{
readNWISuse(years = "ALL", stateAB = NULL, county = NULL,
  convertType = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{integer Years for data retrieval — must be years ending in 0 or 5. Default is all available years.}

\item{stateAB}{character Two-letter USPS state abbreviation.  Only one is accepted per query.  Codes can be located
with the stateCdLookup function for US states. Data for the Virgin Islands (VI), Puerto Rico (PR) and the District
of Columbia is also available.  Default is \code{NULL}, which will return national data.}

\item{county}{character Name(s) of counties.  Default is \code{NULL}, which will return state or national data 
depending on the stateAB argument.  \code{ALL} may also be supplied, which will return data for every county in a 
state. County names be supplied ending in "County" or not — e.g., "Belmont" and "Belmont County" are both acceptable.}

\item{convertType}{logical defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function will convert the data to
numerics based on a standard algorithm. Years, months, and days (if appliccable) are also returned as numerics
in separate columns.  If convertType is false, everything is returned as a character.}
}
\value{
A data frame with at least the year of record, and all available statistics for the given geographic parameters.
County and state fields will be included as appropriate.
