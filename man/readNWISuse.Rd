\title{Water use data retrieval from USGS (NWIS)}
\usage{
readNWISuse(
  stateCd,
  countyCd,
  years = "ALL",
  categories = "ALL",
  convertType = TRUE,
  transform = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stateCd}{could be character (full name, abbreviation, id), or numeric (id).
Only one is accepted per query.}

\item{countyCd}{could be character (name, with or without "County", or "ALL"),
numeric (id), or \code{NULL}, which will
return state or national data depending on the stateCd argument.  "ALL" may
also be supplied, which will return data
for every county in a state. Can be a vector of counties in the same state.}

\item{years}{integer Years for data retrieval. Must be years ending in 0 or 5.
Default is all available years.}

\item{categories}{character categories of water use.  Defaults to "ALL".
Specific categories must be supplied as two-
letter abbreviations as seen in the URL when using the NWIS water use web interface.  Note that
there are different codes for national and state level data.}

\item{convertType}{logical defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function
will convert the data to
numerics based on a standard algorithm. Years, months, and days (if appliccable) are
also returned as numerics
in separate columns.  If convertType is false, everything is returned as a character.}

\item{transform}{logical only intended for use with national data.  Defaults to
\code{FALSE}, with data being returned as
presented by the web service.  If \code{TRUE}, data will be transformed and
returned with column names, which will reformat
national data to be similar to state data.}
}
\value{
A data frame with at least the year of record, and all available
statistics for the given geographic parameters.
County and state fields will be included as appropriate.
