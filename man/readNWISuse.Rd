\title{Water use data retrieval from USGS (NWIS)}
\usage{
readNWISuse(years = "ALL", stateAB = NULL, county = NULL,
  convertType = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{years}{integer Years for data retrieval — must be years ending in 0 or 5. Default is all available years.}

\item{stateAB}{character Two-letter USPS state abbreviation.  Only one is accepted per query.  Codes can be located
with the stateCdLookup function.  Default is \code{NULL}, which will return national data.}

\item{county}{character Name(s) of counties.  Default is \code{NULL}, which will return state or national data 
depending on the stateAB argument.  \code{ALL} may also be supplied, which will return data for every county in a 
state. County names be supplied ending in "County" or not — e.g., "Belmont" and "Belmont County" are both acceptable.}

\item{convertType}{logical defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function will convert the data to
numerics based on a standard algorithm. Years, months, and days (if appliccable) are also returned as numerics
in separate columns.  If convertType is false, everything is returned as a character.}
