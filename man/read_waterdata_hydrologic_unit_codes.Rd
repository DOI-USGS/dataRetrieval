  hydrologic_unit_code = NA_character_,
  hydrologic_unit_name = NA_character_,
  hydrologic_unit_classification_code = NA_character_,
  limit = NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{hydrologic_unit_code}{The format of the code is ('RRSSAACCUUUU') where: 'RR' is the 2-digit code for the Water Resources Council (WRC) Region. 'SS' is the 2-digit code for the WRC subregion. 'AA' is the 2-digit code for the National Water Data Network Accounting Unit. 'CC' is the 2-digit code for the cataloging unit of the catalog of information on water data maintained by the Office of Water Data Coordination (OWDC). 'UUUUUU' is the 6-digit code for a user defined further sub-division of the code.}

\item{hydrologic_unit_name}{Hydrologic unit name.}

\item{hydrologic_unit_classification_code}{Hydrologic unit classification code.}

\item{limit}{The optional limit parameter is used to control the subset of the
selected features that should be returned in each page. The maximum allowable
limit is 10000. It may be beneficial to set this number lower if your internet
connection is spotty. The default (\code{NA}) will set the limit to the maximum
allowable limit for the service.}

\item{max_results}{The optional maximum number of rows to return. This value
must be less than the requested limit.}

\description{
Description Hydrologic units are geographic areas representing part or all of a surface drainage basin or distinct hydrologic feature identified by a unique number (HUC), and a name. The United States is divided and sub-divided into successively smaller hydrologic units which are classified into four levels: regions, sub-regions, accounting units, and cataloging units. Each unit consists of two to eight digits based on the four levels of classification in the hydrologic unit system. Additional information can be found at \url{https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc.html}.
