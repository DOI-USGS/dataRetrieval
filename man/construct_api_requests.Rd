\arguments{
\item{monitoring_location_id}{A unique identifier representing a single monitoring
location. This corresponds to the id field in the sites endpoint. Monitoring
location IDs are created by combining the agency code of the agency responsible
for the monitoring location (e.g. USGS) with the ID number of the monitoring
location (e.g. 02238500), separated by a hyphen (e.g. USGS-02238500).}

\item{parameter_code}{Parameter codes are 5-digit codes used to identify the
constituent measured and the units of measure.}

\item{statistic_id}{A code corresponding to the statistic an observation represents.
Example codes include 00001 (max), 00002 (min), and 00003 (mean).}

\item{properties}{The properties that should be included for each feature. The
parameter value is a comma-separated list of property names. Available values:
id, timeseries_id, monitoring_location_id, parameter_code, statistic_id, time,
value, unit_of_measure, approval_status, qualifier, last_modified.}

\item{bbox}{Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding
box are selected.The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending
on whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or
depth).}

\item{timeseries_id}{A unique identifier representing a single timeseries.
This corresponds to the id field in the timeseries-metadata endpoint.}

\item{id}{A universally unique identifier (UUID) representing a single version
of a record. It is not stable over time. Every time the record is refreshed in
our database (which may happen as part of normal operations and does not imply
any change to the data itself) a new ID will be generated. To uniquely identify
a single observation over time, compare the time and timeseries_id fields; each
timeseries will only have a single observation at a given time.}

\item{approval_status}{Some of the data that you have obtained from this U.S.
Geological Survey database may not have received Director's approval. Any such
data values are qualified as provisional and are subject to revision. Provisional
data are released on the condition that neither the USGS nor the United States
Government may be held liable for any damages resulting from its use. This field
reflects the approval status of each record, and is either "Approved", meaning
processing review has been completed and the data is approved for publication,
or "Provisional" and subject to revision.}

\item{unit_of_measure}{A human-readable description of the units of measurement
associated with an observation.}

\item{qualifier}{This field indicates any qualifiers associated with an observation,
for instance if a sensor may have been impacted by ice or if values were estimated.}

\item{value}{The value of the observation. Values are transmitted as strings
in the JSON response format in order to preserve precision.}

\item{last_modified}{The last time a record was refreshed in our database. This
may happen due to regular operational processes and does not necessarily indicate
anything about the measurement has changed. You can query this field using
date-times or intervals.}

\item{limit}{The optional limit parameter limits the number of items that are
presented in the response document. Only items are counted that are on the
first level of the collection in the response document. Nested objects
contained within the explicitly requested items shall not be counted.}

\item{crs}{Indicates the coordinate reference system for the results.}

\item{bbox_crs}{Indicates the coordinate reference system for the given bbox
coordinates.}

\item{skipGeometry}{This option can be used to skip response geometries for
each feature.}

\item{datetime}{Either a date-time or an interval. Only features that have a
temporal property that intersects the value of datetime are selected. If a 
feature has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the server
whether only a single temporal property is used to determine the extent or
all relevant temporal properties.}

\item{begin}{The datetime of the earliest observation in the timeseries.
Together with end, this field represents the period of record of a timeseries.
Note that some timeseries may have large gaps in their collection record.}

\item{end}{The datetime of the most recent observation in the timeseries.
Data returned by this endpoint updates at most once per day, and potentially
less frequently than that, and as such there may be more recent observations
within a timeseries than the timeseries end value reflects. Together with begin,
this field represents the period of record of a timeseries. It is additionally
used to determine whether a timeseries is "active".}

\item{primary}{A flag identifying if the timeseries is a "primary" timeseries.
"Primary" timeseries (which have this flag) are standard observations which
undergo Bureau review and approval processes. Non-primary timeseries, which
will have missing values for "primary", are provisional datasets made available
to meet the need for timely best science and to assist with daily operations
which need real-time information. Non-primary timeseries data are only retained
by this system for 120 days. See the USGS Provisional Data Statement for more information.}

\item{parameter_name}{A human-understandable name corresponding to parameter_code.}

\item{thresholds}{Thresholds represent known numeric limits for a timeseries,
for example the historic maximum value for a parameter or a level below which
a sensor is non-operative. These thresholds are sometimes used to automatically
determine if an observation is erroneous due to sensor error, and therefore
shouldn't be included in the timeseries.}

\item{sublocation_identifier}{An optional human-readable identifier used to
specify where measurements are recorded at a monitoring location.}

\item{computation_period_identifier}{Indicates the period of data used for
any statistical computations.}

\item{computation_identifier}{Indicates whether the data from this timeseries
represent a specific statistical computation.}

\item{web_description}{A description of what this timeseries represents, as
used by WDFN and other USGS data dissemination products.}

\item{time}{The date an observation represents.}
