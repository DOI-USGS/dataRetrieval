)
}
\arguments{
\item{siteNumbers}{character site number. This needs to include the full agency code prefix.}

\item{parameterCd}{vector of USGS 5-digit parameter code or characteristicNames. 
Leaving this blank will return all of the measured values during the specified time period.}

\item{startDate}{character starting date for data retrieval in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Default is "" which indicates
retrieval for the earliest possible record. Date arguments are always specified in local time.}

\item{endDate}{character ending date for data retrieval in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Default is "" which indicates
retrieval for the latest possible record. Date arguments are always specified in local time.}

\item{tz}{character to set timezone attribute of dateTime. Default is "UTC", and converts the 
date times to UTC, properly accounting for daylight savings times based on the data's provided tz_cd column.
Possible values to provide are "America/New_York","America/Chicago", "America/Denver","America/Los_Angeles",
"America/Anchorage", as well as the following which do not use daylight savings time: "America/Honolulu",
"America/Jamaica","America/Managua","America/Phoenix", and "America/Metlakatla". See also  \code{OlsonNames()} 
for more information on time zones.}

\item{querySummary}{logical to look at number of records and unique sites that will be returned from this query.}

\item{convertType}{logical, defaults to \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function will convert the data to dates, datetimes,
numerics based on a standard algorithm. If false, everything is returned as a character.}

\description{
Imports data from the Water Quality Portal. 
This function gets the data from here: \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us}. There
are four required input arguments: siteNumbers, parameterCd, startDate, and endDate.
parameterCd can either be a USGS 5-digit code, or a characteristic name. The sites can be 
either USGS, or other Water Quality Portal offered sites. It is required to use the 'full'
site name, such as 'USGS-01234567'.
