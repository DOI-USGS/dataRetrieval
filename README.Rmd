The `dataRetrieval` package was created to simplify the process of loading hydrologic data into the R environment. It is designed to retrieve the major data types of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrology data that are available on the Web, as well as data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP), which currently houses water quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and USGS. Direct USGS data is obtained from a service called the National Water Information System (NWIS).

:warning: USGS discrete water-quality data availability and format are changing. Beginning in mid-March 2024 the data obtained from legacy profiles will not include new USGS data or recent updates to existing data. To view the status of changes in data availability and code functionality, visit: https://doi-usgs.github.io/dataRetrieval/articles/Status.html

If you have additional questions about these changes, email CompTools@usgs.gov.

# Sample Workflow

## USGS

```{r workUSGS, eval=FALSE}
library(dataRetrieval)
# Choptank River near Greensboro, MD
siteNumber <- "01491000"
ChoptankInfo <- readNWISsite(siteNumber)
parameterCd <- "00060"

# Raw daily data:
rawDailyData <- readNWISdv(
  siteNumber, parameterCd,
  "1980-01-01", "2010-01-01"
)

pCode <- readNWISpCode(parameterCd)
```

## Water Quality Portal

```{r WQP, eval=FALSE}
specificCond <- readWQPqw(
  siteNumbers = "WIDNR_WQX-10032762",
  parameterCd = "Specific conductance",
  startDate = "2011-05-01",
  endDate = "2011-09-30"
)
```

## Network Linked Data Index

```{r NLDI, eval=FALSE}
features <- findNLDI(
  nwis = "01491000",
  nav = "UT",
  find = c("basin", "wqp")
)
```

# Installation of dataRetrieval

To install the `dataRetrieval` package, you must be using R 3.0 or greater and run the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dataRetrieval")
```

To get cutting-edge changes, install from GitHub using the `remotes` packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(remotes)
install_github("DOI-USGS/dataRetrieval",
               build_vignettes = TRUE, 
               build_opts = c("--no-resave-data",
                              "--no-manual"))
```

# Citations

## Citing the dataRetrieval package

```{r cite, eval=TRUE}
citation(package = "dataRetrieval")
```

## Citing NWIS data

U.S. Geological Survey, 2023, National Water Information System data available on the World Wide Web (USGS Water Data for the Nation), accessed [April 26, 2023], at http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/. http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN

This can be done using the `create_NWIS_bib` function:


```{r}

dv <- readNWISdv("09010500", "00060")

NWIScitation <- create_NWIS_bib(dv)

NWIScitation
print(NWIScitation, style = "Bibtex")


```

## Citing WQP data

Citations for specific datasets should use this format:

National Water Quality Monitoring Council, YYYY, Water Quality Portal, accessed mm, dd, yyyy, hyperlink_for_query, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QRKUVJ.

This can be done using the `create_WQP_bib` function:

```{r}
SC <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = "USGS-05288705",
                parameterCd = "00300")

WQPcitation <- create_WQP_bib(SC)
WQPcitation
print(WQPcitation, style = "Bibtex")
```

## Citing Water Quality Portal itself

General Water Quality Portal citations should use the following:

Water Quality Portal. Washington (DC): National Water Quality Monitoring Council, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); 2021. https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QRKUVJ.

# Package Support

The Water Mission Area of the USGS supports the development and maintenance of `dataRetrieval`, and most likely further into the future. Resources are available primarily for maintenance and responding to user questions. Priorities on the development of new features are determined by the `dataRetrieval` development team. This software was last released with USGS record: IP-147158.
