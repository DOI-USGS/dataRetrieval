This article will describe the R-package "dataRetrieval" which simplifies the process of finding and retrieving water data from the U.S. Geological Survey and other agencies.

# Package Overview

`dataRetrieval` is available on Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dataRetrieval")
```

Once the `dataRetrieval` package has been installed, it needs to be loaded in order to use any of the functions:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(dataRetrieval)
```

There are several vignettes  included within the `dataRetrieval` package. The following command will open the main package introduction:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
vignette("dataRetrieval", package = "dataRetrieval")
```

Additionally, each function has a help file. These can be accessed by typing a question mark, followed by the function name in the R console:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?read_waterdata_daily
```

Each function's help file has working examples to demonstrate the usage. The examples may have comments "## Not run". These examples CAN be run, they just are not run by the CRAN maintainers due to the external service calls.

Finally, if there are still questions that the vignette and help files don't answer, please post an issue on the `dataRetrieval` GitHub page:

<https://github.com/DOI-USGS/dataRetrieval/issues>

# Orientation

`dataRetrieval` provides US water data mainly via 3 sources:

* National Water Information System (NWIS)
* Water Quality Portal (WQP)
* USGS APIs (Water Data), which are new or in-development . 

Functions in `dataRetrieval` look like `readNWISdv`, `readNWISuv`, `readWQPqw`, `whatNWISdata`, etc. What does that mean? The functions are generally structured with a prefix, middle, and suffix:

* _Prefix_: "read" or "what"
    + "read" will access full data sets
    + "what" will access data availability
* _Middle_: "NWIS", "waterdata", "WQP":
    + NWIS functions get data from legacy NWIS web services. 
    + Water Data (waterdata) functions are the functions that will eventually replace the legacy NWIS functions. These pull from modern USGS API services.
    + WQP functions are for discrete water-quality data from the Water Quality Portal.
* _Suffix_: "data" or other:
    + Functions that end in "data": These are flexible, powerful functions that allow complex user queries.
    + Functions that don't end with "data" are user-friendly functions that assume site, code, and start/end dates are known.



# Data Overview

There are many types of data served from NWIS. To understand how the services are separated, it's helpful to understand that each data type is retrieved from a completely different web service or API.

* NWIS has traditionally been the source for all USGS water data

* Legacy NWIS services will be retired (scheduled 2026, but uncertain):
  * <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/nwisweb-decommission-summary/>
  
* USGS water data functions will slowly replace NWIS functions
  * `read_waterdata_samples` has replaced `readNWISqw`
  * `read_waterdata_daily` can replace `readNWISdv`
  * `read_waterdata_monitoring_location` can replace `readNWISsite`
  * `read_waterdata_ts_meta` can replace `whatNWISdata`
  * `read_waterdata_parameter_codes` can replace `readNWISpCode`
  
* Discrete water quality data:
  * WQP functions should be used when accessing non-USGS discrete water quality data
  * `read_waterdata_samples` should be used for USGS data

## USGS Basic Retrievals

The USGS uses various codes for basic retrievals. These codes can have leading zeros, therefore they need to be a character ("01234567").

* Site ID (often 8 or 15-digits)
* Parameter Code (5 digits)
    + Full list: `read_waterdata_parameter_codes()`
* Statistic Code (for daily values)
    + Full list: `read_waterdata_metadata("statistic-codes")`


Here are some examples of a few common parameter codes:


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(knitr)

df <- data.frame(
  pCode = c("00060", "00065", "00010", "00400"),
  shName = c("Discharge", "Gage Height", "Temperature", "pH")
)

names(df) <- c("Parameter Codes", "Short Name")

df2 <- data.frame(
  pCode = c("00001", "00002", "00003", "00008"),
  shName = c("Maximum", "Minimum", "Mean", "Median")
)

names(df2) <- c("Statistic Codes", "Short Name")

knitr::kable(list(df, df2))
```



Use the `read_waterdata_parameter_codes` function to get information on USGS parameter codes.Then use your favorite data analysis methods to pull out what you need. Here is one example to find all the phosphorous parameter codes:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
pcode <- read_waterdata_parameter_codes()

phosCds <- pcode[grep("phosphorus",
  pcode$parameter_name,
  ignore.case = TRUE
), ]

```

Explore the wide variety of parameters that contain "phosphorus" in the parameter_name:

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(DT)
datatable(phosCds[, c("parameter_code", "parameter_name", "unit_of_measure")],
  rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 4)
)
```

### User-friendly retrievals: NWIS

Sometimes, you know exactly what you want. If you know:

1. The type of data (groundwater, unit values, daily values,  etc..)
2. USGS site number(s)
3. USGS parameter code(s)
4. Time frame (start and end date)

You can use the "user-friendly" functions. These functions take the same 4 inputs (sites, parameter codes, start date, end date), and deliver data from the different NWIS services.

# Pheasant Branch Creek Example

Let's start by asking for discharge (parameter code = 00060) at a site right next to the old USGS office in Wisconsin (Pheasant Branch Creek). 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
siteNo <- "USGS-05427948"
pCode <- "00060"
start.date <- "2023-10-01"
end.date <- "2024-09-30"

pheasant <- read_waterdata_daily(monitoring_location_id = siteNo,
                            parameter_code = pCode,
                            time = c(start.date, end.date))
```

From the Pheasant Creek example, let's look at the data. The column names are:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
names(pheasant)
```


Let's make a simple plot to see the data:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3.5}
library(ggplot2)
ts <- ggplot(
  data = pheasant,
  aes(time, value)) +
  geom_line()
ts
```

Then we can use the `read_waterdata_parameter_codes` and `read_waterdata_monitoring_location` functions to create better labels:


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3.5}
parameterInfo <- read_waterdata_parameter_codes(pCode)
siteInfo <- read_waterdata_monitoring_location(siteNo)

ts <- ts +
  xlab("") +
  ylab(parameterInfo$parameter_name) +
  ggtitle(siteInfo$monitoring_location_name)
ts
```

## Known USGS site, unknown service/pcode

The most common question the dataRetrieval team gets is:

"I KNOW this site has data but it's not coming out of dataRetrieval! Where's my data?"

First verify that the data you think is available is actually associated with the location. For time series data, use the `read_NWIS_ts_meta` function to find out the available time series data. 

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)

site <- "USGS-05407000"
ts_data_available <- read_waterdata_ts_meta(monitoring_location_id = site) 


data_available <- ts_data_available |> 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |> 
  mutate(begin = as.Date(begin),
         end = as.Date(end)) |> 
  select(parameter_name, parameter_code, statistic_id, computation_identifier,
         begin, end) 
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(data_available,
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 7,
                         lengthChange = FALSE,
                         searching = FALSE)
)

```

The time series that have "Instantaneous" in the computation_identifier column will be available in the instantaneous data service (currently `readNWISuv`), and the rest of the data will be available in the daily service (`read_waterdata_daily`).

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
dv_pcodes <- data_available$parameter_code[data_available$computation_identifier != "Instantaneous"]
stat_cds <- data_available$statistic_id[data_available$computation_identifier != "Instantaneous"]

dv_data <- read_waterdata_daily(monitoring_location_id = site,
                           parameter_code = unique(dv_pcodes),
                           statistic_id = unique(stat_cds))

uv_pcodes <- data_available$parameter_code[data_available$computation_identifier == "Instantaneous"]

uv_data <- readNWISuv(siteNumbers = gsub("USGS-", "", site),
                      parameterCd = unique(uv_pcodes))

peak_data <- readNWISpeak(gsub("USGS-", "", site))

```

For discrete water quality data, use the `summarize_waterdata_samples` function:

```{r echo=TRUE}
discrete_data_available_all <- summarize_waterdata_samples(site) 

discrete_data_available <- discrete_data_available_all |> 
  select(parameter_name = characteristicUserSupplied, 
         begin = firstActivity, end = mostRecentActivity,
         count = resultCount)

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(discrete_data_available,
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 7,
                         lengthChange = FALSE,
                         searching = FALSE)
)

```

The discrete water quality data can be accessed with the `read_waterdata_samples` function:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
samples_data <- read_waterdata_samples(monitoringLocationIdentifier = site, 
                                  dataProfile = "basicphyschem")
```


# Water Quality Portal (WQP)

`dataRetrieval` also allows users to access data from the [Water Quality Portal](http://www.waterqualitydata.us/). The WQP houses data from multiple agencies; while USGS data comes from the NWIS database, EPA data comes from the STORET database (this includes many state, tribal, NGO, and academic groups). The WQP brings data from all these organizations together and provides it in a single format that has a more verbose output than NWIS. 

This tutorial will use the modern WQX3 format. This is still considered "beta", but it is the best way to get up-to-date multi-agency data.

The single user-friendly function is `readWQPqw`. This function will take a site or vector of sites in the first argument "siteNumbers". USGS sites need to add "USGS-" before the site number. 

The 2nd argument "parameterCd". Although it is called "parameterCd", it can take EITHER a USGS 5-digit parameter code OR a characterisitc name (this is what non-USGS databases use). Leaving "parameterCd" as empty quotes will return all data for a site. 

So we could get all the water quality data for site `r site` like this:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
qw_data_all <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = site,
                         parameterCd = "", 
                         legacy = FALSE)
```

or 1 parameter code:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
qw_data_00095 <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = site,
                           parameterCd = "00095", 
                           legacy = FALSE)
```

or 1 characteristic name:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
qw_data_sp <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = site,
                        parameterCd = "Specific conductance", 
                        legacy = FALSE)
```


#  Discover Data

This is all great when you know your site numbers. What do you do when you don't?

There are 2 `dataRetrieval` functions that help with USGS data discovery:

*  `read_waterdata_monitoring_location` finds sites within a specified filter 
*  `read_waterdata_ts_meta` summarizes the time series meta data 

And 2 functions that help with discover in WQP:

*  `readWQPsummary` summarizes the data available within the WQP by year.
*  `whatWQPdata` summarizes the data available within the WQP.


Available geographic filters are individual site(s), a single state, a bounding box, or a HUC (hydrologic unit code). See examples for those services by looking at the help page for the `readNWISdata` and `readWQPdata` functions:

Here are a few examples:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Daily temperature in Ohio
ohio_sites <- read_waterdata_monitoring_location(state_name = "Ohio")
ohio_ts_meta <- read_waterdata_ts_meta(bbox = sf::st_bbox(ohio_sites),  
                                  parameter_code = "00010")

# Real-time discharge at a site
instFlow <- readNWISdata(
  sites = "05114000",
  service = "iv",
  parameterCd = "00060",
  startDate = "2014-05-01T00:00Z",
  endDate = "2014-05-01T12:00Z",
  tz = "America/Chicago"
)

# Groundwater levels within a HUC:
groundwaterHUC <- readNWISdata(
  huc = "02070010",
  service = "gwlevels"
)
```
  
#  Time/Time zone discussion

* The arguments for all `dataRetrieval` functions concerning dates (startDate, endDate) can be R Date objects, or character strings, as long as the string is in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

* For functions that include a date and time, `dataRetrieval` will take that information and create a column that is a POSIXct type. By default, this date/time POSIXct column is converted to "UTC". In R, one vector (or column in a data frame) can only have __ONE__ timezone attribute.

    + Sometimes in a single state, some sites will acknowledge daylight savings and some don't
    + `dataRetrieval` queries could easily span multiple timezones (or switching between daylight savings and regular time)

* The user can specify a single timezone to override UTC. The allowable tz arguments are `OlsonNames` (see also the help file for `readNWISuv`). 


# Large Data Requests

It is increasingly common for R users to be interested in large-scale `dataRetrieval` analysis. You can use a loop of either state codes (`stateCd$STATE`) or HUCs to make large requests. BUT without careful planning, those requests could be too large to complete. Here are a few tips to make those queries manageable:

* Please do NOT use multi-thread processes and simultaneously request hundreds or thousands of queries.

* Take advantage of the `whatWQPdata` and `whatNWISdata` functions to filter out sites you don't need before requesting the data. Use what you can from these faster requests to filter the full data request as much as possible. 

* Think about using `tryCatch`, saving the data after each iteration of the loop, and/or using a make-like data pipeline (for example, see the `drake` package). This way if a single query fails, you do not need to start over.

* The WQP doesn't always perform that well when there are a lot of filtering arguments in the request. Even though those filters would reduce the amount of data needed to transfer, that sometimes causes the pre-processing of the request to take so long that it times-out before returning *any* data. It's a bit counterintuitive, but if you are having trouble getting your large requests to complete, remove arguments such as Sample Media, Site Type, these are things that can be filtered in a post-processing script. Another example: sometimes it is slower and error-prone requesting data year-by-year instead of requesting the entire period of record. 

* Pick a single state/HUC/bbox to practice your data retrievals before looping through larger sets, and optimize ahead of time as much as possible.

There are two examples [scripting](https://doi-usgs.github.io/dataRetrieval/articles/wqp_large_pull_script.html) and [pipeline](https://doi-usgs.github.io/dataRetrieval/articles/wqp_large_pull_targets.html) that go into more detail.

# But wait, there's more!

There are two services that also have functions in `dataRetrieval`, the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGWMN) and Network Linked Data Index (NLDI). These functions are not as mature as the WQP and NWIS functions. A future blog post will bring together these functions. 

## National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGWMN)

Similar to WQP, the NGWMN brings groundwater data from multiple sources into a single location. There are currently a few `dataRetrieval` functions included:


*  `readNGWMNsites()`
*  `readNGWMNlevels()`
*  `readNGWMNdata()`.

## Network Linked Data Index (NLDI)

The NLDI provides a information backbone to navigate the NHDPlusV2 network and discover features indexed to the network. For an overview of the NLDI, see: [https://rconnect.usgs.gov/dataRetrieval/articles/nldi.html](https://rconnect.usgs.gov/dataRetrieval/articles/nldi.html)
