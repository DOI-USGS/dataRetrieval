## WQP: USGS Data

Limited availability of new USGS data: starting approximately February 12, 2024, there will be a period when new USGS data will not be accessible on the Water Quality Portal. Data will still be collected but will not be publicly available. This limited availability is expected to last a few weeks.

Recent USGS data will be accessible again upon release of the new Data Profiles, which will be in the WQX 3.0 format. These profiles should be available in March, 2024.

These profiles are not yet available to test. When the are, we will update this page with recommendations.
