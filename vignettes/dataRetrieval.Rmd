The `dataRetrieval` package was created to simplify the process of loading hydrologic data into the R environment. It is designed to retrieve the major data types of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic data that are available on the Web, as well as data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP), which currently houses water quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and USGS. Direct USGS data is obtained from a service called the USGS Water Data API. 

For information on getting started in R and installing the package, see [Getting Started](#getting-started-in-r). Any use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.

A quick workflow using `dataRetrieval` functions:

```{r workflow, echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
library(dataRetrieval)
# Choptank River near Greensboro, MD
siteNumber <- "USGS-01491000"
ChoptankInfo <- read_waterdata_monitoring_location(siteNumber)
parameterCd <- "00060"

# Raw daily data:
rawDailyData <- read_waterdata_daily(monitoring_location_id = siteNumber,
                                     parameter_code = parameterCd,
                                     time = c("1980-01-01", "2010-01-01"))


pCode <- read_waterdata_parameter_codes(parameter_code = parameterCd)
```

## USGS Data API Access Tokens

USGS data are made available through the USGS water data APIs. You can register an API key for use with USGS water data APIs. There are now limits on how many queries can be requested per IP address per hour. If you find yourself running into limits, you can request an API token here: <https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/signup/>

Then save your token in your .Renviron file like this:

```
API_USGS_PAT = "my_super_secret_token"
```

You can use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` to edit find and open your .Renviron file. You will need to restart R for that variable to be recognized. 

Table 1 describes the functions available in the `dataRetrieval` package.

# USGS Web Retrievals

In this section we'll show how to get raw data into R. This data includes [site information](#site-information), measured [parameter information](#parameter-information), historical [daily values](#daily-data), [unit values](#unit-data) (which include real-time data but can also include other sensor data stored at regular time intervals), [groundwater level data](#groundwater-level-data), [peak flow data](#peak-flow-data), [rating curve data](#rating-curve-data),  [surface-water measurement data](#surface-water-measurement-data), [water use data](#water-use-data), and [statistics data](#statistics-data). The section [Embedded Metadata](#embedded-metadata) shows instructions for getting metadata that is attached to each returned data frame.

The USGS organizes hydrologic data in a standard structure.  Streamgages are located throughout the United States, and each streamgage has a unique ID (referred in this document and throughout the `dataRetrieval` package as `siteNumber`).  Often (but not always), these ID's are 8 digits for surface-water sites and 15 digits for groundwater sites.  The first step to finding data is discovering this `siteNumber`. There are many ways to do this, one is the [National Water Information System: Mapper](https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html).

Once the `siteNumber` is known, the next required input for USGS data retrievals is the "parameter code".  This is a 5-digit code that specifies the measured parameter being requested.  For example, parameter code 00631 represents "Nitrate plus nitrite, water, filtered, milligrams per liter as nitrogen", with units of "mg/l as N". 

Not every station will measure all parameters. A short list of commonly measured parameters is shown in Table 2.

```{r tableParameterCodes, echo=FALSE}


pCode <- c("00060", "00065", "00010", "00045", "00400")
shortName <- c(
  "Discharge [ft<sup>3</sup>/s]",
  "Gage height [ft]",
  "Temperature [C]",
  "Precipitation [in]",
  "pH"
)

data.df <- data.frame(pCode, shortName, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

kable(data.df,
  caption = "Table 2: Common USGS Parameter Codes"
)
```

Two output columns that may not be obvious are "srsname" and "casrn". Srsname stands for "Substance Registry Services". Casrn stands for "Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number". 

For unit values data (sensor data measured at regular time intervals such as 15 minutes or hourly), knowing the parameter code and `siteNumber` is enough to make a request for data.  For most variables that are measured on a continuous basis, the USGS also stores the historical data as daily values.  These daily values are statistical summaries of the continuous data, e.g. maximum, minimum, mean, or median. The different statistics are specified by a 5-digit statistics code.  

Some common codes are shown in Table 3.

```{r tableStatCodes, echo=FALSE}
StatCode <- c("00001", "00002", "00003", "00008")
shortName <- c("Maximum", "Minimum", "Mean", "Median")

data.df <- data.frame(StatCode, shortName, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

kable(data.df,
  caption = "Table 3: Commonly used USGS Stat Codes"
)
```

Examples for using these site numbers, parameter codes, and statistic codes will be presented in subsequent sections.


## Site Information


### read_waterdata_monitoring_location

Use the `read_waterdata_monitoring_location` function to obtain all of the information available for a particular USGS site (or sites) such as full station name, drainage area, latitude, and longitude. `read_waterdata_monitoring_location` can also access information about multiple sites with a vector input.


```{r getSite, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
siteNumbers <- c("USGS-01491000", "USGS-01645000")
siteINFO <- read_waterdata_monitoring_location(siteNumbers)
```

Site information is obtained from:
<https://api.waterdata.usgs.gov/ogcapi/v0/collections/monitoring-locations>

### read_waterdata_ts_meta

To discover what time series data is available for a particular USGS site, including measured parameters, period of record, and number of samples (count), use the `read_waterdata_ts_meta` function. 

In the following example, we limit the retrieved data to only daily data. 


```{r getSiteExtended, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Continuing from the previous example:
# This pulls out just the daily, mean data:

dailyDataAvailable <- read_waterdata_ts_meta(
  monitoring_location_id = siteNumbers, 
  computation_period_identifier = "Daily",
  statistic_id = "00003"
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

tableData <- dailyDataAvailable[c("monitoring_location_id",
                         "parameter_description",
                         "unit_of_measure",
                         "begin", "end")]

tableData$begin <- as.Date(tableData$begin)
tableData$end <- as.Date(tableData$end)
tableData <- sf::st_drop_geometry(tableData)


knitr::kable(tableData,
             caption = "Table 4: Reformatted version of output from the read_waterdata_ts_meta function for the Choptank River near Greensboro, MD, and from Seneca Creek at Dawsonville, MD from the daily values service [Some columns deleted for space considerations]")

## Parameter Information

To obtain all of the available information concerning a measured parameter (or multiple parameters), use the `read_waterdata_parameter_codes` function:

```{r label=getPCodeInfo, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# Using defaults:
parameterCd <- "00618"
parameterINFO <- read_waterdata_parameter_codes(parameter_code = parameterCd)
```


## Daily Data

To obtain daily records of USGS data, use the `read_waterdata_daily` function. 

```{r label=getNWISDaily, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# Choptank River near Greensboro, MD:
siteNumber <- "USSG-01491000"
parameterCd <- "00060" # Discharge
startDate <- "2009-10-01"
endDate <- "2012-09-30"

discharge <- read_waterdata_daily(monitoring_location_id = siteNumber,
                                  parameter_code = parameterCd, 
                                  time = c(startDate, endDate))
```

The column "time" in the returned data frame is automatically imported as a variable of class "Date" in R. 

Another example would be a request for mean and maximum daily temperature and discharge in early 2012:

```{r label=getNWIStemperature, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
siteNumber <- "USGS-01491000"
parameterCd <- c("00010", "00060") # Temperature and discharge
statCd <- c("00001", "00003") # Mean and maximum
startDate <- "2012-01-01"
endDate <- "2012-05-01"

temperatureAndFlow <- read_waterdata_daily(monitoring_location_id = siteNumber,
                                  parameter_code = parameterCd, 
                                  statistic_id = statCd,
                                  time = c(startDate, endDate))
```

```{r label=getNWIStemperature2, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
filePath <- system.file("extdata", package = "dataRetrieval")
fileName <- "temperatureAndFlow.RData"
fullPath <- file.path(filePath, fileName)
load(fullPath)
```


An example of plotting the above data:

```{r}

temperature <- temperatureAndFlow[temperatureAndFlow$parameter_code == "00010",]
temperature <- temperature[temperature$statistic_id == "00001",]

flow <- temperatureAndFlow[temperatureAndFlow$parameter_code == "00060",]

par(mar = c(5, 5, 5, 5)) # sets the size of the plot window

plot(temperature$time, temperature$value,
  ylab = "Maximum Temperture [C]",
  xlab = ""
)
par(new = TRUE)
plot(flow$time,
  flow$value,
  col = "red", type = "l",
  xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
  xlab = "", ylab = "",
  axes = FALSE
)
axis(4, col = "red", col.axis = "red")
mtext("Discharge [ft3/s]", side = 4, line = 3, col = "red")
title("CHOPTANK RIVER NEAR GREENSBORO, MD")
legend("topleft", unique(temperatureAndFlow$unit_of_measure),
  col = c("black", "red"), lty = c(NA, 1),
  pch = c(1, NA)
)
```


## Unit Data

Any data collected at regular time intervals (such as 15-minute or hourly) are known as "unit values". Many of these are delivered on a real time basis and very recent data (even less than an hour old in many cases) are available through the function `read_waterdata_continuous`.  Here is an example of a retrieval of such data.  

```{r label=readNWISuv, eval=FALSE}

parameterCd <- "00060" # Discharge
startDate <- "2012-05-12"
endDate <- "2012-05-13"
dischargeUnit <- read_waterdata_continuous(monitoring_location_id = siteNumber,
                                           parameter_code = parameterCd,
                                           time = c(startDate, endDate))

```

The retrieval produces a data frame that contains 96 rows (one for every 15 minute period in the day).  They include all data collected from the `startDate` through the `endDate` (starting and ending with midnight locally-collected time). The dateTime column is converted to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), so midnight EST will be 5 hours earlier in the dateTime column (the previous day, at 7pm).


## Groundwater Level Data

Groundwater level measurements can be obtained with the `read_waterdata_field_measurements` function. 

```{r gwlexample, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
siteNumber <- "USGS-434400121275801"
groundWater <- read_waterdata_field_measurements(monitoring_location_id = siteNumber)
```


## Peak Flow Data

Peak flow data are instantaneous discharge or stage data that record the maximum values of these variables during a flood event.  They include the annual peak flood event but can also include records of other peaks that are lower than the annual maximum. Peak discharge measurements can be obtained with the `readNWISpeak` function. Information on the returned data can be found with the `comment` function and attached attributes as described in the [metadata](#embedded-metadata) section.

```{r peakexample, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
siteNumber <- "01594440"
peakData <- readNWISpeak(siteNumber)
```


## Rating Curve Data

Rating curves are the calibration curves that are used to convert measurements of stage to discharge.  Because of changing hydrologic conditions these rating curves change over time. Information on the returned data can be found with the `comment` function and attached attributes as described in the [metadata](#embedded-metadata) section.

Rating curves can be obtained with the `readNWISrating` function.

```{r ratingexample, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ratingData <- readNWISrating(siteNumber, "base")
attr(ratingData, "RATING")
```


## Surface-Water Measurement Data

These data are the discrete measurements of discharge that are made for the purpose of developing or revising the rating curve.  Surface-water measurement data can be obtained with the `read_waterdata_field_measurements` function.

```{r surfexample, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
surfaceData <- read_waterdata_field_measurements(monitoring_location_id = "USGS-01594440")
```


## Water Use Data

Legacy water use data services have been retired. Check back in for developments on replacement functions.


## Statistics Data
Retrieves site statistics from the USGS Statistics Web Service beta.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
discharge_stats <- readNWISstat(
  siteNumbers = c("02319394"),
  parameterCd = c("00060"),
  statReportType = "annual"
)
```


# Water Quality Portal Web Retrievals

Water quality data sets available from the [Water Quality Data Portal](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/).  These data sets can be housed in either the STORET database (data from EPA) and NWIS database (data from USGS).  Because only USGS uses parameter codes, a "characteristic name" must be supplied.  The `readWQPqw` function can take either a USGS parameter code, or a more general characteristic name in the parameterCd input argument. The Water Quality Data Portal includes data discovery tools and information on characteristic names. The following example retrieves specific conductance from a DNR site in Wisconsin. 


```{r label=getQWData, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
specificCond <- readWQPqw(
  "WIDNR_WQX-10032762",
  "Specific conductance",
  "2011-05-01", "2011-09-30"
)
```


## WQP 

Just as with NWIS, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) offers a variety of ways to search for sites and request data. The possible Web service arguments for WQP site searches is found [here](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation).

### Sites: whatWQPsites

To discover available sites in the WQP in New Jersey that have measured Chloride, use the function `whatWQPsites`.

```{r NJChloride, eval=FALSE}

sitesNJ <- whatWQPsites(
  statecode = "US:34",
  characteristicName = "Chloride"
)
```


### Data: readWQPdata

To get data from the WQP using generalized Web service calls, use the function `readWQPdata`. For example, to get all the pH data in Wisconsin:

```{r phData, eval=FALSE}
dataPH <- readWQPdata(
  statecode = "US:55",
  characteristicName = "pH"
)
```


### Availability: whatWQPdata

The function `whatWQPdata` returns a data frame with information on the amount of data collected at a site. For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
type <- "Stream"
sites <- whatWQPdata(countycode = "US:55:025", siteType = type)
```

This returns a data frame with all of the sites that were measured in streams in Dane County, WI. Also, in that table, there is a measure of `activityCount` (how often the site was sampled), and `resultCount` (how many individual results are available).

### Samples: whatWQPsamples

The function `whatWQPsamples` returns information on the individual samples collected at a site. For example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
site <- whatWQPsamples(siteid = "USGS-01594440")
```

This returns one row for each instance that a sample was collect.

### Metrics: whatWQPmetrics

The function `whatWQPmetrics` provides metric information. This is only currently available for STORET data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
type <- "Stream"
sites <- whatWQPmetrics(countycode = "US:55:025", siteType = type)
```


# Getting Started in R

This section describes the options for downloading and installing the `dataRetrieval` package.

## New to R?
 
If you are new to R, you will need to first install the latest version of R, which can be found [here] (www.R-project.org).

At any time, you can get information about any function in R by typing a question mark before the functions name.  This will open a file (in RStudio, in the Help window) that describes the function, the required arguments, and provides working examples. This will open a help file similar to the image below. To see the raw code for a particular code, type the name of the function, without parentheses.


```
?read_waterdata_parameter_codes
```

Additionally, many R packages have vignette files attached (such as this paper). To see the list of vignettes in a package:
```{r seeVignette,eval = FALSE}
# to see all available vignettes:
vignette(package="dataRetrieval")

#to open a specific vignette:
vignette(topic = "qwdata_changes", package = "dataRetrieval")
```


# Citations

## Citing the dataRetrieval package

```{r cite, eval=TRUE}
citation(package = "dataRetrieval")
```

## Citing NWIS data

The requested format is: 

U.S. Geological Survey, 2023, National Water Information System data available on the World Wide Web (USGS Water Data for the Nation), accessed [April 26, 2023], at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/. https://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN

This can be created from the attributes of the data using the `create_NWIS_bib` function:


```{r nwisCite, eval=FALSE}

dv <- readNWISdv("09010500", "00060")

NWIScitation <- create_NWIS_bib(dv)
NWIScitation
```

```

System data available on the World Wide Web (USGS Water Data
for the Nation)_. doi:10.5066/F7P55KJN

```
Alternative output is available:

```{r show1, eval=FALSE}
print(NWIScitation, style = "Bibtex")
```

```

## Citing WQP data

Citations for specific datasets should use this format:

National Water Quality Monitoring Council, YYYY, Water Quality Portal, accessed mm, dd, yyyy, hyperlink_for_query, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QRKUVJ.

This can be obtained using the `create_WQP_bib` function:

```{r WQPcite, eval=FALSE}
SC <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = "USGS-05288705",
                parameterCd = "00300")

WQPcitation <- create_WQP_bib(SC)
WQPcitation
```
