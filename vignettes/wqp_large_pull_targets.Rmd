## Background

The Water Quality Portal ([WQP](https://www.waterqualitydata.us/))
database aggregates and standardizes discrete water quality data from
numerous federal, state, tribal, and other monitoring agencies. The WQP
enables the access and retrieval of over 297,000,000 water quality
records (Read et al. 2017) through web services and an application
programming interface (API) that can be called programmatically using
the
[`dataRetrieval`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html)
package in R. Downloading data from the WQP represents a common pattern
across USGS data teams. 

In this post, we highlight an [example data
pipeline](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/) to increase the reusability, reproducibility, and efficiency of
WQP data workflows. This post is an alternative method to the script-based workflow presented in [Large sample pulls using dataRetrieval](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/large_sample_pull/). We've designed it with large-scale data pulls in mind, but this example pipeline will work at any spatial or temporal scale.

## Why targets?

The workflow described here uses the [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) package to leverage modular functions, dependency tracking, and automated workflows to inventory and download data from the Water Quality Portal. Using `targets` allows the user to develop a maintainable pipeline that tracks changes over time and will only re-run portions of the workflow that are out of date due to those changes.

The basic ingredient of a `targets` workflow is a script file named `_targets.R`. This file is used to define and configure all of the steps in an analysis pipeline and their connections to each other. After connecting the individual analysis steps (also known as targets) in the `_targets` file, the `targets` package can then track the relationships between each connection. Analysis steps that precede any given step of interest are considered "upstream" while the analysis steps that follow are considered "downstream". Once these connections have been established, `targets` can also visualize the relationships in a network graph like the one shown below. The WQP pipeline is structured so that various inputs - including the date range, spatial extent, parameters of interest, and/or specific arguments to pass along to WQP queries - can all be modified within the [`_targets.R`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/_targets.R) file.

## Pulling data from the Water Quality Portal

The WQP targets pipeline is divided into three phases that divide the
workflow:

1.  [**Inventory**](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/1_inventory.R) what sites and records are available in the WQP  
2.  [**Download**](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/2_download.R) the inventoried data  
3.  [**Harmonize**](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/3_harmonize.R), or clean, the downloaded data to prepare the dataset
    for further analysis

This post will focus on how to carry out bulk data pulls using the first
two phases of the pipeline.

### Decide which characteristic names to query

The first step is to decide which water quality parameters should be
included in the data pull. One challenge posed by the aggregated WQP
database is that many characteristic names may refer to the same water
quality parameter (e.g., temperature records can take on different values
for `CharacteristicName`, including `"Temperature"` or
`"Temperature, water"`). The WQP pipeline includes a configuration file
to help map various WQP characteristics onto more commonly-used
parameter groups ([`1_inventory/cfg/wqp_codes.yml`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/1_inventory/cfg/wqp_codes.yml)).

Here we are interested in compiling temperature data, so we define this
parameter group within [`_targets.R`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/_targets.R#L24).

The characteristic names belonging to “temperature” are parsed in
[`p1_char_names`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/5d7eaec10172f22abe0eaaa7f3934e303252a0dd/1_inventory.R#L32-L35) to create a vector of `CharacteristicName` values that
are then used as input to the WQP query. Which values of
`CharacteristicName` to include may vary depending on the needs of a
specific project and which entries are considered valid in WQP, which can
change over time. To accommodate this variability, the configuration file can be edited to omit
certain characteristic names or include new ones. For example, we might
think of a new characteristic name that contains temperature records and
add that to the configuration file. This simple example illustrates a
decision that users of WQP data must make, but that can sometimes be
difficult to do so with confidence (i.e., *is “temp” really a valid
characteristic name?*). Two pipeline features are designed to
assist the user when making these decisions. First, all requested
characteristic names from the configuration file are checked against a
list of valid entries in WQP, and will notify the user if a
characteristic name is not valid.

{{< figure src="/static/wqp-large-pull-targets/pipeline_snap_char_names.png" width="850px" alt="A screenshot of the R console output for the example pipeline. The console output indicates that the wqp characteristic target named p1_char_names and all of the associated upstream targets are building. After building the console warns that the temp characteristic does not exist in the water quality portal. This warning message is one of the two pipeline features that can help the user determine whether or not they have specified a valid characteristic name.">}}

So we can see that our newly-added characteristic name “temp” is not a
valid entry and can be omitted from the configuration file. Second,
a user may wonder whether there are other characteristic names they
might have missed. The pipeline includes a target
[`p1_similar_char_names_txt`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/5d7eaec10172f22abe0eaaa7f3934e303252a0dd/1_inventory.R#L37-L43) that uses [fuzzy string
matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) to
check for valid characteristics that are similar to the requested
parameters, and return an output file that can be evaluated by the user.

In `p1_char_names` we end up with a list of characteristic names to use
in the query:

```r
> tar_load(p1_char_names)
> p1_char_names
[1] "Temperature"               "Temperature, sample"       "Temperature, water"        "Temperature, water, deg F"
>
```

### Define the area of interest

The next step is to define the spatial extent of the data pull. In this
example, we are requesting data for a triangular “watershed” northwest
of Philadelphia, PA, which we’ve specified in [`_targets.R`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/5d7eaec10172f22abe0eaaa7f3934e303252a0dd/_targets.R#L26-L29) using a set
of latitude and longitude coordinates.

```r
# Specify coordinates that define the spatial area of interest
# lat/lon are referenced to WGS84
coords_lon <- c(-77.063, -75.333, -75.437)
coords_lat <- c(40.547, 41.029, 39.880)
```

Although we use spatial coordinates, a user could also easily use other,
predefined boundaries by replacing the targets [`p1_AOI` and `p1_AOI_sf`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/1_inventory.R#L50-L62)
with targets that download and read in an external shapefile:

```r
# Download a shapefile containing the Delaware River Basin boundary
  tar_target(
    p1_shp_zip,
    {
      fileout <- "1_inventory/out/drbbnd.zip"
      utils::download.file("https://www.state.nj.us/drbc/library/documents/GIS/drbbnd.zip",
                  destfile = fileout,
                  mode = "wb", quiet = TRUE)
      fileout
    },
    format = "file"
  ),

# Unzip the shapefile and read in as an sf polygon object
  tar_target(
    p1_AOI_sf,
    {
      savedir <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(p1_shp_zip)
      unzip(zipfile = p1_shp_zip, exdir = savedir, overwrite = TRUE)
      sf::st_read(paste0(savedir,"/drb_bnd_arc.shp"), quiet = TRUE) %>%
        sf::st_cast(.,"POLYGON")
    }
  ),
```

In this example, the area of interest is relatively small and we could
probably request all of the temperature data within the boundary of our
triangular watershed without issue. However, what if we wanted to
download WQP data for the full state of Pennsylvania? This would result
in a much bigger request! The WQP pipeline is built around the central
idea that smaller queries to the WQP are more likely to succeed and
therefore, most workflows that pull WQP data would benefit from dividing
larger requests into smaller ones.

One way we break up larger data pulls is by using a set of grid cells to
define the spatial extent of multiple, smaller queries that, when
combined, represent a data inventory for the full area of interest. The
size of each grid cell can be customized by the user, but using 1 degree
cell sizes results in a set of five grid cells that overlap our
example watershed:

{{< figure src="/static/wqp-large-pull-targets/map_original_grid_cells.png" width="475px" alt="A screenshot of a map that includes the example watershed of interest, the grid cells used to chunk and query data from WQP, and a gray-scale background map on the northeastern United States. The map depicts the user-specified area of interest that is located near Philadephia Pennslyvania and defined in the p1_AOI_sf target and the five grid cells defined by the p1_global_grid_aoi target.">}}

### Inventory the data before downloading

We use `targets`
[“branching”](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/dynamic.html)
capabilities to apply (or *map*) our data inventory and download
functions over each grid cell that overlaps our area of interest. The
user can quickly reference the number of sites and records that were
returned in the inventory by referencing a saved log file. If using the
pipeline along with `git` for version control, this log file also allows
a user to readily track changes to the data over the time. 

{{< figure src="/static/wqp-large-pull-targets/log_file.png" width="300px" alt="A screenshot of the log file csv generated by the pipeline. The log file includes a table with the following columns: characteristic name, number of sites, and number of records. The record depcited is for water temperature. It includes 504 sites and 8773 records.">}}

### Little by little: break up the inventoried sites to prepare for download

The initial data inventory lets us know how many sites and records we
can expect for each unique `CharacteristicName` in our query. Before
actually downloading the data, we bin the inventoried sites within each
grid cell into distinct download groups so that the total number of
records in any given download group does not exceed a user-specified maximum
threshold (defaults to [250,000 records per download group](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/99a90c159bcebc4d5ac2e90fbc85734547217a4a/2_download.R#L19-L21)). This binning
step acts as another safeguard against timeout issues with large data
requests, but also allows us to take advantage of `targets` dependency
tracking to efficiently build or update the data pipeline. For example,
we do not have to re-download *all* of the data records from WQP just
because we added a new characteristic name or because new sites
were recently uploaded to WQP and detected in our inventory. `targets`
will only update those data subsets that become “outdated” by an
upstream change.

### Download the data!

We’re finally ready to download the data from the Water Quality Portal
and do so by mapping the function [`fetch_wqp_data()`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/2_download.R#L40-L46) over each unique
download group recombining the data in
`p2_wqp_data_aoi`. As a check on our downloaded data, we compare the
expected number of sites and records from [`p1_wqp_inventory_summary_csv`](https://github.com/USGS-R/ds-pipelines-targets-example-wqp/blob/main/2_download.R#L48-L54)
against the number of sites and records that were actually downloaded,
and inform the user of the result:

{{< figure src="/static/wqp-large-pull-targets/pipeline_snap_check_inventory.png" width="850px" alt="A screenshot of the R console output for the example pipeline. The console shows that temperature datadata has been retrieved from 228 sites. It also shows that the records downloaded match the records produced by the pipeline inventory. The output message reads: all good! the expected number of records from the WQP inventory matches the data pull for all characteristics.">}}

### Updating the data pull

As we mentioned above, `targets` dependency tracking allows us to
efficiently update our pipeline or expand our region of interest without
re-pulling grids that have already been queried. To illustrate, say we
decide to expand an analysis to include areas west of our initial focal
watershed. The map below shows that the area of interest now overlaps six
grid cells instead of five, but the five original grids are still
included in our query. Using common scripting workflows we would usually
just re-pull all of the data again even though that is time-consuming.

{{< figure src="/static/wqp-large-pull-targets/map_updated_grid_cells.png" width="475px" alt="A screenshot of a map that includes the updated example watershed of interest, the grid cells used to chunk and query data from WQP, and a gray-scale background map on the northeastern United States. In this map the watershed of interest defined in p1_AOI_sf is bigger than in the first map and there are six grid cells in the p1_global_grid_aoi target.">}}

However, `targets` recognizes that data has already been inventoried for
five of these grid cells and will only query data for the newly-added
grid, `46902`:

{{< figure src="/static/wqp-large-pull-targets/pipeline_snap_update_inventory.png" width="600px" alt="A screenshot of the R console output for the example pipeline that shows a partial rebuild of the p1_wqp_inventory target. After re-defining the area of interest, the pipeline rebuilds the inventory for the new grid cell in p1_global_grid_aoi target, but it doesn't need to rebuild the inventory from the other five grid cells because they have already been inventoried.">}}

## Customizing the pipeline

Our goal is for you to take this example pipeline and tailor it to your
own projects. Users can customize the spatial extent, the date range,
the list of water quality parameters of interest, and add new functions
for harmonizing data for various water quality constituents.
