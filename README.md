The `dataRetrieval` package was created to simplify the process of
loading hydrologic data into the R environment. It is designed to
retrieve the major data types of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrology
data that are available on the Web, as well as data from the Water
Quality Portal (WQP), which currently houses water quality data from the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA), and USGS. Direct USGS data is obtained from a service called the
National Water Information System (NWIS).

:warning: USGS discrete water-quality data availability and format are
changing. Beginning in mid-March 2024 the data obtained from legacy
profiles will not include new USGS data or recent updates to existing
data. To view the status of changes in data availability and code
functionality, visit:

If you have additional questions about these changes, email
<CompTools@usgs.gov>.

# Sample Workflow

## USGS

``` r
library(dataRetrieval)
# Choptank River near Greensboro, MD
siteNumber <- "01491000"
ChoptankInfo <- readNWISsite(siteNumber)
parameterCd <- "00060"

# Raw daily data:
rawDailyData <- readNWISdv(
  siteNumber, parameterCd,
  "1980-01-01", "2010-01-01"
)

pCode <- readNWISpCode(parameterCd)
```

## Water Quality Portal

``` r
specificCond <- readWQPqw(
  siteNumbers = "WIDNR_WQX-10032762",
  parameterCd = "Specific conductance",
  startDate = "2011-05-01",
  endDate = "2011-09-30"
)
```

## Network Linked Data Index

``` r
features <- findNLDI(
  nwis = "01491000",
  nav = "UT",
  find = c("basin", "wqp")
)
```

# Installation of dataRetrieval

To install the `dataRetrieval` package, you must be using R 3.0 or
greater and run the following command:

``` r
install.packages("dataRetrieval")
```

To get cutting-edge changes, install from GitHub using the `remotes`
packages:

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("DOI-USGS/dataRetrieval",
               build_vignettes = TRUE, 
               build_opts = c("--no-resave-data",
                              "--no-manual"))
```

## Citing the dataRetrieval package

``` r
citation(package = "dataRetrieval")

## Citing NWIS data

U.S. Geological Survey, 2023, National Water Information System data
available on the World Wide Web (USGS Water Data for the Nation),
accessed \[April 26, 2023\], at <http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/>.
<http://dx.doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN>

This can be done using the `create_NWIS_bib` function:

``` r

dv <- readNWISdv("09010500", "00060")

NWIScitation <- create_NWIS_bib(dv)

NWIScitation
#> U.S. Geological Survey (2024). _National Water Information System data
#> available on the World Wide Web (USGS Water Data for the Nation)_.
#> doi:10.5066/F7P55KJN <https://doi.org/10.5066/F7P55KJN>, Accessed Feb
#> 20, 2024,
#> <https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/dv/?site=09010500&format=waterml,1.1&ParameterCd=00060&StatCd=00003&startDT=1851-01-01>.
print(NWIScitation, style = "Bibtex")
#> @Manual{,
#>   title = {National Water Information System data available on the World Wide Web (USGS Water Data for the Nation)},
#>   author = {{U.S. Geological Survey}},
#>   doi = {10.5066/F7P55KJN},
#>   note = {Accessed Feb 20, 2024},
#>   year = {2024},
#>   url = {https://waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/dv/?site=09010500&format=waterml,1.1&ParameterCd=00060&StatCd=00003&startDT=1851-01-01},
#> }
```

## Citing WQP data

Citations for specific datasets should use this format:

National Water Quality Monitoring Council, YYYY, Water Quality Portal,
accessed mm, dd, yyyy, hyperlink_for_query,
<https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QRKUVJ>.

This can be done using the `create_WQP_bib` function:

``` r
SC <- readWQPqw(siteNumbers = "USGS-05288705",
                parameterCd = "00300")

WQPcitation <- create_WQP_bib(SC)
WQPcitation
#> National Water Quality Monitoring Council (2024). _ Water Quality
#> Portal_. doi:10.5066/P9QRKUVJ <https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QRKUVJ>,
#> Accessed Feb 20, 2024,
#> <https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?siteid=USGS-05288705&pCode=00300&mimeType=tsv&zip=yes>.
print(WQPcitation, style = "Bibtex")
#> @Manual{,
#>   title = { Water Quality Portal},
#>   author = {{National Water Quality Monitoring Council}},
#>   doi = {10.5066/P9QRKUVJ},
#>   note = {Accessed Feb 20, 2024},
#>   year = {2024},
#>   url = {https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?siteid=USGS-05288705&pCode=00300&mimeType=tsv&zip=yes},
#> }
```

## Citing Water Quality Portal itself

General Water Quality Portal citations should use the following:

Water Quality Portal. Washington (DC): National Water Quality Monitoring
Council, United States Geological Survey (USGS), Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA); 2021. <https://doi.org/10.5066/P9QRKUVJ>.

# Package Support

The Water Mission Area of the USGS supports the development and
maintenance of `dataRetrieval`, and most likely further into the future.
Resources are available primarily for maintenance and responding to user
questions. Priorities on the development of new features are determined
by the `dataRetrieval` development team. This software was last released
with USGS record: IP-147158.
