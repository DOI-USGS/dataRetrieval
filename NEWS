* Minor bug fixes
* Help file updates
* Improved query options in readNWISdata and readWQPdata functions.

dataRetrieval 2.1.4
===========
* Expanded readNWISdata to qw data
* Improved citation file


dataRetrieval 2.1.1
===========
* Removed tests that call external web services, server upgrades have been causing false negative results
* Added functionality to readWQPdata to allow R objects as arguments rather than just character strings
* Added parameterCd='all' option for qw calls.
* Exposed sysdata constants


dataRetrieval 2.0.2
===========
* Moved data files (parameterCdFile and pCodeToName) to hidden sysdata.rda
* Improved error handling.
* Fixed WaterML2 bug.
* Switched readNWISgwl to read the RDB output.

dataRetrieval 2.0.1
===========
* Removed deprecated functions.
* Added siteInfo and variableInfo dataframe attributes to all data retrival functions
* Improved help files
* Added data file (pCodeToName) that shows the association of USGS parameter code to characteristicName

dataRetrieval 2.0.0
===========
* Overhaul of function names based on initial user feedback
* Metadata attributes added to returned dataframes
* EGRET specific functions moved to EGRET


dataRetrieval 1.4.0
===========

* Changed WaterML2 rbind fill from plyr function to dplyr. Removed plyr import, added dplyr.
*


dataRetrieval 1.3.3
===========

* Updated getNWISSiteInfo to retrieve multiple site file datasets at once using a vector of siteNumbers as input argument.
* Updated error-handling for Web service calls. More information is returned when errors happen
* Added some basic processing to Water Quality Portal raw data retrievals. Date columns are returned as Date objects, value columns are numeric, and a column is created from the date/time/timezone columns that is POSIXct.
* Added very generalized NWIS and WQP retrieval functions (getNWISData, getNWISSites, getGeneralWQPData, and whatWQPsites) which allow the user to use any argument available on the Web service platform.


dataRetrieval 1.3.2
===========

* Deprecated getQWData, updated readWQPdata to take either parameter code or characteristic name.
* Changed the name of raw data retrievals to: readNWISqw, getNWISunitData, getNWISdvData, and getWQPqwData (from: readNWISqw, retrieveUnitNWISData, retrieveNWISData, getRawQWData)
* Added NA warning to getDVData function
* Updated mergeReport to allow for Sample data with different measurements taken on the same day


dataRetrieval 1.2.2
===========

* Added getNWISDataAvailability function to find measured parameters and period of record information for a requested station.

* Added constructNWISURL function to get the URL that is used to retrieve the data.

* Added getSampleSTORET function to get STORET data directly in Sample dataframe form.

* Fixed a small leap year bug by changing day of year by making Feb. 29 always 59, and March 1st always 60 (even in non-leap years).

dataRetrieval 1.2.1
===========

* Improved documentation, especially example functions.

* Improved vignette for a more complete walk-through.

* Expanded the capabilities to retrieve raw data from the web services.

* Added Storet data retrievals in readWQPdata function
