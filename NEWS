* Remove reshape2 and dplyr dependencies
* Added ability to customize user agent using options UA.dataRetrieval

dataRetrieval 2.7.3
==========
* Reworked whatNWISdata to allow the full flexibility of `...`
* Check for dates in instantaneous data, allowing requests for recent data to be routed directly to waterservices.gov.

dataRetrieval 2.7.1
==========
* Converted vignette to html

dataRetrieval 2.7.0
==========
* Added National Groundwater Monitoring Network services
* Converted WaterML2 code from XML to XML2 dependency. NOTE: The output of this the parseWaterML2 function has changed. This is a first step to a more robust WaterML2 parser
* Added new Water Quality Portal features: whatWQPmetrics, whatWQPdata, whatWQPsamples
* Bug fix on converting GET -> POST
* Bug fix on state abbrieviations
* Minor updates to internal code to improve efficiencies.

dataRetrieval 2.6.3
==========
* All USGS web services are being flipped from http to https. This version of dataRetrieval will attempt to access https, if that fails, will attempt http.

dataRetrieval 2.5.12
==========
* Response to readr 1.0.0 updates
* Added NWIS Water Use data
* Added NWIS Statistical Service data
* Added message on updates to NWIS data on startup message
* Automatically retries web service calls when status code is greater than 400
* More integrated use of pkg.env to set base URLs

dataRetrieval 2.5.7
==========
* HEAD requests can be returned in readWQP* functions. This can give some indication on amount of data available.

dataRetrieval 2.5.0
==========
* Package httr is now used for web service retrievals

dataRetrieval 2.4.0
==========
* Package readr now used for tab delimited parsing
* readr functions used to determine column types. Mostly, this produces the same results.
* In the case where there is text in a numeric column (specified by the RDB header), these now remain characters (previously was converted to numeric)
* Columns that come back from web services as integers remain integers (previously was converted to numeric)
* Added reported time zone code information. dateTime columns by default get converted to UTC, but the original time zone code (tz_cd for instance) is appended to the data frame.

dataRetrieval 2.3.0
===========
* Converted all Water Quality Portal queries to sorted=no to greatly improve retrieval times
* Converted gwlevels in readNWISdata to rdb


dataRetrieval 2.2.0
===========
* Changed the output of tz_cd (in all *NWIS functions) to the timezone that is reported in the data frame. Before this version, it was the time zone reported by NWIS. This was confusing however since the dateTime columns default to UTC.
* Minor bug fixes
* Help file updates
* Improved query options in readNWISdata and readWQPdata functions.

dataRetrieval 2.1.4
===========
* Expanded readNWISdata to qw data
* Improved citation file


dataRetrieval 2.1.1
===========
* Removed tests that call external web services, server upgrades have been causing false negative results
* Added functionality to readWQPdata to allow R objects as arguments rather than just character strings
* Added parameterCd='all' option for qw calls.
* Exposed sysdata constants


dataRetrieval 2.0.2
===========
* Moved data files (parameterCdFile and pCodeToName) to hidden sysdata.rda
* Improved error handling.
* Fixed WaterML2 bug.
* Switched readNWISgwl to read the RDB output.

dataRetrieval 2.0.1
===========
* Removed deprecated functions.
* Added siteInfo and variableInfo dataframe attributes to all data retrival functions
* Improved help files
* Added data file (pCodeToName) that shows the association of USGS parameter code to characteristicName

dataRetrieval 2.0.0
===========
* Overhaul of function names based on initial user feedback
* Metadata attributes added to returned dataframes
* EGRET specific functions moved to EGRET


dataRetrieval 1.4.0
===========
* Changed naming convention:
* Changed WaterML2 rbind fill from plyr function to dplyr. Removed plyr import, added dplyr.
*


dataRetrieval 1.3.3
===========

* Updated getNWISSiteInfo to retrieve multiple site file datasets at once using a vector of siteNumbers as input argument.
* Updated error-handling for Web service calls. More information is returned when errors happen
* Added some basic processing to Water Quality Portal raw data retrievals. Date columns are returned as Date objects, value columns are numeric, and a column is created from the date/time/timezone columns that is POSIXct.
* Added very generalized NWIS and WQP retrieval functions (getNWISData, getNWISSites, getGeneralWQPData, and whatWQPsites) which allow the user to use any argument available on the Web service platform.


dataRetrieval 1.3.2
===========

* Deprecated getQWData, updated readWQPdata to take either parameter code or characteristic name.
* Changed the name of raw data retrievals to: readNWISqw, getNWISunitData, getNWISdvData, and getWQPqwData (from: readNWISqw, retrieveUnitNWISData, retrieveNWISData, getRawQWData)
* Added NA warning to getDVData function
* Updated mergeReport to allow for Sample data with different measurements taken on the same day


dataRetrieval 1.2.2
===========

* Added getNWISDataAvailability function to find measured parameters and period of record information for a requested station.

* Added constructNWISURL function to get the URL that is used to retrieve the data.

* Added getSampleSTORET function to get STORET data directly in Sample dataframe form.

* Fixed a small leap year bug by changing day of year by making Feb. 29 always 59, and March 1st always 60 (even in non-leap years).

dataRetrieval 1.2.1
===========

* Improved documentation, especially example functions.

* Improved vignette for a more complete walk-through.

* Expanded the capabilities to retrieve raw data from the web services.

* Added Storet data retrievals in readWQPdata function
