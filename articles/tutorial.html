<p>R is an open-source programming language. It is known for extensive
statistical capabilities, and also has powerful graphical capabilities.
Another benefit of R is the large and generally helpful user-community.
This includes R-package developers who create packages that can be
easily installed to enhance the basic R capabilities. This article will
describe the R-package “dataRetrieval” which simplifies the process of
finding and retrieving water from the U.S. Geological Survey and other
agencies.</p>
<p>It is increasingly common for large-scale <code>dataRetrieval</code>
requests. Geographically-large requests can be done by looping through
either state codes (<code>stateCd$STATE</code>) or HUCs. BUT without
careful planning, those requests could be too large to complete. This
article will describe some tips to make those queries manageable.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="package-overview">Package Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-overview"></a>
</h2>
<p><code>dataRetrieval</code> is available on Comprehensive R Archive
Network (CRAN).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html" class="external-link">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"dataRetrieval"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once the <code>dataRetrieval</code> package has been installed, it
needs to be loaded in order to use any of the functions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://code.usgs.gov/water/dataRetrieval" class="external-link">dataRetrieval</a></span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are several vignettes included within the
<code>dataRetrieval</code> package. The following command will open the
main package introduction:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/vignette.html" class="external-link">vignette</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"dataRetrieval"</span>, package <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"dataRetrieval"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Additionally, each function has a help file. These can be accessed by
typing a question mark, followed by the function name in the R
console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="op">?</span><span class="va">readNWISuv</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each function’s help file has working examples to demonstrate the
usage. The examples may have comments “## Not run”. These examples CAN
be run, they just are not run by the CRAN maintainers due to the
external service calls.</p>
<p>Finally, if there are still questions that the vignette and help
files don’t answer, please post an issue on the
<code>dataRetrieval</code> GitHub page:</p>

<p>USGS data comes from the National Water Information System (NWIS).
There are many types of data served from NWIS. To understand how the
services are separated, it’s helpful to understand the terms here:</p>

</h3>
<p>The USGS uses various codes for basic retrievals. These codes can
have leading zeros, therefore in R they need to be a character
(“01234567”).</p>
<ul>
<li>Site ID (often 8 or 15-digits)</li>
<li>Parameter Code (5 digits)
<ul>
<li>Full list:</li>

<p>Sometimes, you know exactly what you want. If you know:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The type of data (groundwater, unit, water quality, daily,
etc..)</li>
<li>USGS site number(s)</li>
<li>USGS parameter code(s)</li>
<li>Time frame (start and end date)</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use the “user-friendly” functions. These functions take the
same 4 inputs (sites, parameter codes, start date, end date), and
deliver data from different NWIS services:</p>

<p>Let’s start by asking for discharge (parameter code = 00060) at a
site right next to the USGS office in Wisconsin (Pheasant Branch
Creek).</p>

<p>From the Pheasant Creek example, let’s look at the data. The column
names are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/names.html" class="external-link">names</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">pheasant</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>

<span><span class="co">## [5] "X_00060_00000_cd" "tz_cd"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The names of the columns are based on the parameter and statistic
codes. In many cases, you can clean up the names with the convenience
function <code>renameNWISColumns</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="co">## [6] "tz_cd"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The returned data also has several attributes attached to the data
frame. To see what the attributes are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/names.html" class="external-link">names</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/attributes.html" class="external-link">attributes</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">pheasant</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>

<span><span class="co">## [9] "queryTime"</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Each <code>dataRetrieval</code> return should have the attributes:
url, siteInfo, and variableInfo. Additional attributes are available
depending on the data.</p>

<p>This is all great when you know your site numbers. What do you do
when you don’t?</p>
<p>There are 2 <code>dataRetrieval</code> functions that help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>whatNWISsites</code> finds sites within a specified filter
(quicker)</li>
<li>
<code>whatNWISdata</code> summarizes the data within the specified
filter (more information)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several ways to specify the requests. The best way to
discover how flexible the USGS web services are is to click on the links
and see all of the filtering options: <a href="http://waterservices.usgs.gov/" class="external-link">http://waterservices.usgs.gov/</a></p>
<p><img src="waterservices.png" width="408"></p>
<p>Available geographic filters are individual site(s), a single state,
a bounding box, or a HUC (hydrologic unit code). See examples for those
services by looking at the help page for the <code>readNWISdata</code>
function:</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>Our team is actively working on making our data more discoverable.
For now, we encourage you to use interactive mappers such as:</p>
<p>The NWIS Mapper: <a href="http://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html" class="external-link">http://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html</a></p>
<p>The National Water Dashboard: <a href="https://dashboard.waterdata.usgs.gov/app/nwd" class="external-link">https://dashboard.waterdata.usgs.gov/app/nwd</a></p>

<p>Let’s do one more example, we’ll look for long-term USGS phosphorous
data in Wisconsin. This time, we will take the information from the
<code>whatNWISdata</code> function, filter down the sites to exactly our
interest, and then get the data. Let’s say we want data from sites that
have been collecting data for at least 15 years and have at least 300
measurements:</p>

<p><code>dataRetrieval</code> also allows users to access data from the
<a href="http://www.waterqualitydata.us/" class="external-link">Water Quality Portal</a>. The
WQP houses data from multiple agencies; while USGS data comes from the
NWIS database, EPA data comes from the STORET database (this includes
many state, tribal, NGO, and academic groups). The WQP brings data from
all these organizations together and provides it in a single format that
has a more verbose output than NWIS. To get non-NWIS data, need to use
CharacteristicName instead of parameter code.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="wqp-basic-retrievals">WQP Basic Retrievals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#wqp-basic-retrievals"></a>
</h3>
<p>Much like the convenience functions for NWIS, there’s a simple
function for retrievals if the site number and parameter code or
characteristic name is known.</p>

<p>The value of the Water Quality Portal is to explore water quality
data from different sources.</p>
<p>The following function returns sites that have collected phosphorus
data in Wisconsin. There’s no way to know if that site has collected one
sample, or thousands. This function is pretty fast, but only reports
which sites have data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">phosSites</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/wqpSpecials.html">whatWQPsites</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similar to NWIS, to find out the scope of the available data, there
is a <code>whatWQPdata</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">phos_data_available</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/whatWQPdata.html">whatWQPdata</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span>  characteristicName <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Phosphorus"</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function comes back with a few really useful columns such as
“activityCount” and “resultCount”. As with our NWIS query, let’s filter
down our data request to sites that have only had more than 300
measurements.</p>

<p>With data coming from many different agencies, it will be important
to carefully review the returned data. For instance, this “Phosphorus”
data comes back with many different units. It will be important to make
smart decisions on how and if the queried data can be used together.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The arguments for all <code>dataRetrieval</code> functions
concerning dates (startDate, endDate) can be R Date objects, or
character strings, as long as the string is in the form
“YYYY-MM-DD”.</p></li>
<li>
<p>For functions that include a date and time,
<code>dataRetrieval</code> will take that information and create a
column that is a POSIXct type. By default, this date/time POSIXct column
is converted to “UTC”. In R, one vector (or column in a data frame) can
only have <strong>ONE</strong> timezone attribute.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes in a single state, some sites will acknowledge daylight
savings and some don’t</li>
<li>
<code>dataRetrieval</code> queries could easily span multiple
timezones (or switching between daylight savings and regular time)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The user can specify a single timezone to override UTC. The
allowable tz arguments are <code>OlsonNames</code> (see also the help
file for <code>readNWISuv</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>readNWISqw</code> may create both a “startDateTime” and
“endDateTime” if the data is appropriate. Both columns will have the
timezone attribute from the user-defined “tz_cd” column. The originally
reported timezones are retained in the
“sample_start_time_datum_cd_reported” and
“sample_end_time_datum_cd_reported” columns.</p></li>

<h2 id="large-data-requests">Large Data Requests<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#large-data-requests"></a>
</h2>
<p>It is increasingly common for R users to be interested in large-scale
<code>dataRetrieval</code> analysis. You can use a loop of either state
codes (<code>stateCd$STATE</code>) or HUCs to make large requests. BUT
without careful planning, those requests could be too large to complete.
Here are a few tips to make those queries manageable:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Please do NOT use multi-thread processes and simultaneously
request hundreds or thousands of queries.</p></li>
<li><p>Take advantage of the <code>whatWQPdata</code> and
<code>whatNWISdata</code> functions to filter out sites you don’t need
before requesting the data. Use what you can from these faster requests
to filter the full data request as much as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about using <code>tryCatch</code>, saving the data after
each iteration of the loop, and/or using a make-like data pipeline (for
example, see the <code>drake</code> package). This way if a single query
fails, you do not need to start over.</p></li>
<li><p>The WQP doesn’t always perform that well when there are a lot of
filtering arguments in the request. Even though those filters would
reduce the amount of data needed to transfer, that sometimes causes the
pre-processing of the request to take so long that it times-out before
returning <em>any</em> data. It’s a bit counterintuitive, but if you are
having trouble getting your large requests to complete, remove arguments
such as Sample Media, Site Type, these are things that can be filtered
in a post-processing script. Another example: sometimes it is slower and
error-prone requesting data year-by-year instead of requesting the
entire period of record.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a single state/HUC/bbox to practice your data retrievals
before looping through larger sets, and optimize ahead of time as much
as possible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are two services that also have functions in
<code>dataRetrieval</code>, the National Groundwater Monitoring Network
(NGWMN) and Network Linked Data Index (NLDI). These functions are not as
mature as the WQP and NWIS functions. A future blog post will bring
together these functions.</p>

<h3 id="national-groundwater-monitoring-network-ngwmn">National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGWMN)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#national-groundwater-monitoring-network-ngwmn"></a>
</h3>
<p>Similar to WQP, the NGWMN brings groundwater data from multiple
sources into a single location. There are currently a few
<code>dataRetrieval</code> functions included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="../reference/readNGWMNsites.html">readNGWMNsites()</a></code></li>
<li><code><a href="../reference/readNGWMNlevels.html">readNGWMNlevels()</a></code></li>

<h3 id="network-linked-data-index-nldi">Network Linked Data Index (NLDI)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#network-linked-data-index-nldi"></a>

<p>The NLDI provides a information backbone to navigate the NHDPlusV2
network and discover features indexed to the network. For an overview of
the NLDI, see: <a href="https://rconnect.usgs.gov/dataRetrieval/articles/nldi.html" class="external-link">https://rconnect.usgs.gov/dataRetrieval/articles/nldi.html</a></p>
<p>There is currently one function in dataRetrieval for NLDI:</p>
