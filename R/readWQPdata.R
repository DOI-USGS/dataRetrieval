#' General Data Import from Water Quality Portal
#'
#' Imports data from Water Quality Portal web service. This function gets the data from here: \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us}.
#' because it allows for other agencies rather than the USGS.  
#'
#' @param \dots see \url{https://www.waterqualitydata.us/webservices_documentation} for a complete list of options. A list of arguments can also be supplied. 
#' @param querySummary logical to ONLY return the number of records and unique sites that will be returned from this query. This argument is not supported via the combined list from the \dots argument
#' @param tz character to set timezone attribute of dateTime. Default is "UTC", and converts the 
#' date times to UTC, properly accounting for daylight savings times based on the data's provided tz_cd column.
#' Possible values to provide are "America/New_York","America/Chicago", "America/Denver","America/Los_Angeles",
#' "America/Anchorage", as well as the following which do not use daylight savings time: "America/Honolulu",
#' "America/Jamaica","America/Managua","America/Phoenix", and "America/Metlakatla". See also  \code{OlsonNames()} 
#' for more information on time zones.
